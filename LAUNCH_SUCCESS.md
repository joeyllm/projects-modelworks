# 🎉 Clinical Coding Assistant - Successfully Launched!

## ✅ **Issue Resolved**

The compilation errors have been **completely resolved** by moving the project to a clean directory without special characters in the name.

### **Problem**: 
- Directory name `#1 Clinical Coder Final` contained `#` character
- This caused webpack and babel compilation errors
- Module resolution failed due to path issues

### **Solution**:
- Created new clean directory: `clinical-coding-portal`
- Moved all files to the new location
- Reinstalled dependencies
- Application now compiles and runs successfully
