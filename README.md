# ðŸ¦˜ - Clinical Trials with JoeyLLM

## Basic Setup ðŸ©º

**You can import the project by using either of the two following methods:**

* Make your own Next.js app, and then copy and paste the files from this repository to the appropriate directories.
  * Ensure that the `MainContainer.jsx` file will be in the `page.jsx` file! 
* Pull the repository to your local device
  * There is a chance that the node_modules folder will be missing, so it might be best to try and get this folder elsewhere (probably by making your own app and then copying and pasting the folder to this one)

**After this, you'll need to have an API key and hook it up to the program.**

* You can do this by visiting `.env.local` and copying and pasting your key to the following part of the file:

**You can test if implementation has been successful by running the following in your terminal:**

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) (or an alternative, which is stated once you run these commands) with your browser to see the result.
