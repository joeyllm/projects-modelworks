Design Considerations for an Australian Clinical Coding Assistant

1. Expected Search and Navigation Features
Australian clinical coders will expect robust search and code lookup tools integrated into the assistant. This includes the ICD-10-AM and ACHI classification content (alphabetic indexes and tabular lists) built-in for quick reference. Users should be able to search diagnoses or procedures by keywords (with support for synonyms, abbreviations, etc.) and retrieve the correct code options. Intelligent search capabilities (e.g. auto-complete, “see also” suggestions) can guide coders through complex coding pathways, ensuring they follow the classification rules. 
Coder workflows also demand Diagnosis Related Group (DRG) grouping support – the system should compute the AR-DRG in real time as codes are assigned, or allow one-click grouping of the episode. This helps coders verify the case’s DRG and ensure it aligns with expected outcomes (important for funding). Navigation should allow browsing by classification hierarchy as well (for example, drilling down via chapters/blocks if needed).

In summary, coders expect a code lookup interface that is fast, Australian-specific, and up-to-date with the ICD-10-AM/ACHI/ACS Thirteenth Edition content, combined with features like on-the-fly DRG calculation and possibly indicators for things like Hospital Acquired Complications (HACs) as they code. All these search and navigation tools should “work the way coders work,” providing menus, prompts, and references that streamline finding and confirming codes.

3. Surfacing and Correcting OCR Transcription
For scanned doctors’ notes, the system should employ OCR to extract text, and present that transcription to the coder in a user-friendly, reviewable format. A best practice is to display the original document (or image) side-by-side with the OCR text, so coders can visually verify the transcription. Low-confidence words or phrases (which the OCR is unsure about) should be highlighted or flagged for review. For example, one interface design highlights uncertain words in the transcribed text and puts a red bounding box around the corresponding word in the scanned image. The coder could click on a highlighted word to see a drop-down of OCR-suggested alternatives or closest matches, with the highest-confidence suggestion pre-selected.

In this way, the system surfaces potential errors transparently: the transcribed text is visible and editable, and any ambiguous terms are easy to spot and correct. The coder should be able to correct the text inline (e.g. choosing the correct word from suggestions or typing in a fix) without much friction. Ideally, navigating through these uncertainties is efficient – for instance, pressing a key to accept the top suggestion or skip to the next issue. Once the OCR text is reviewed and corrected, it can be treated as the source for coding. 
This reviewed transcription might even allow the assistant to highlight key medical terms for coding (diagnoses, medications, procedures) to expedite code search. Overall, OCR results should be presented in a split view with the source image, with intuitive controls for the coder to confirm or correct the text easily. This ensures that even handwritten or poor-quality scans can be reliably used in the coding process, with the coder as the final quality check.

5. Output Structure and Export-Ready Format
The coding assistant should produce outputs that mirror the structure used in Australian hospitals for reporting and billing. Typically, this means listing all diagnosis and procedure codes assigned to the episode, along with any supplementary codes (e.g. external cause codes, morphology codes for neoplasms, etc.), in a structured summary. Coders will expect the output to differentiate Principal Diagnosis vs. Additional Diagnoses, and similarly identify Primary Procedure vs. additional procedures, since these distinctions are important. It’s helpful to organize related codes into clusters for clarity. For example, multiple codes that collectively describe one clinical scenario should be grouped together in the output.

An injury code would be grouped with its external cause and place of occurrence codes as one “cluster,” a cancer diagnosis code would cluster with its morphology and any palliative care code, and so on. (Australian coding practice already uses sequencing to indicate such clusters – e.g. injury with external cause, or a disease with its manifestation – and the software can make this explicit by visually grouping them.) Each code in the output should include its full description for verification, and any relevant flags or attributes (e.g. the Condition Onset Flag for diagnoses to show if it arose during admission).
In addition to human-readable summaries, the system must support exporting the coded data in a format ready for the government billing portal or hospital billing system. Australian hospitals typically transmit coded episodes via standardized formats – for instance, through an HL7 message to the patient administration system or by creating a fixed-field text file for the state health data collection. The assistant could offer a “mock export” function that generates the file or data packet in the required schema (with all necessary identifiers, codes, DRG, patient details, etc.). 

This would allow coding compliance officers to take the output and upload it directly to the government portal for funding claims without re-formatting. The export should align with Australian national and jurisdictional reporting requirements, which update with each ICD/DRG edition. In summary, coders need the output both in a clear on-screen format (grouped by clinical meaning, with code clusters and summaries) and in a data format that can be submitted for billing without additional manual manipulation.

7. Interface Layout for Episodic Case Review
A coder’s interface should be organized to review one patient episode (admission) efficiently, typically involving multiple documents and a set of codes. A side-by-side layout is highly beneficial: one panel can display the patient’s documentation while the adjacent panel is used for coding. In practice, many coders use dual monitors for this purpose – our design can emulate that by, say, showing the OCR-transcribed text (or even the original scanned document) on the left and the coding workspace on the right.

The documentation panel might allow toggling between different source documents (e.g. discharge summary, progress notes, operative report), perhaps as tabs or a list, so the coder can quickly navigate the episode’s records. The coding panel would contain the search bar and coding pathways, the list of selected codes, and the real-time DRG display. This parallel view means the coder doesn’t have to constantly switch contexts; they can read a diagnosis in the notes and immediately find/assign the code in the next panel. 

It’s important to maintain visibility of key patient details too – for example, basic demographics or length of stay could be shown in a header, and any alerts (like documentation queries or flags) could be visible. The interface should be modular but unified: users shouldn’t need to open separate applications for coding books, grouping, or references – everything is accessible in one workspace. This not only speeds up coding but also reduces errors from transcribing between systems.

To support collaboration and clarification, include the collapsible “Chat with Docs” widget as specified. This could appear as a small tab or button on the interface that expands into a chat panel. When expanded, the coder can message a clinician (or clinical documentation specialist) with questions about unclear documentation. This chat panel should not obstruct the main view; hence a collapsible design is ideal – the coder opens it when needed to type a query (for example, “Doctor, was this diabetes diagnosis meant to be Type 1 or Type 2?”) and then hides it to continue coding. The chat history might be saved with the episode for compliance tracking. 
Overall, the layout should facilitate an “episodic case review” workflow: the coder sequentially reviews documentation, assigns codes, verifies grouping, and queries doctors all in one screen. Features like resizable panels or dual-pane scrolling (keeping the code list visible while scrolling through notes) can further enhance usability. The design principle is to minimize context-switching – coders should “have no need to jump from application to application to code an episode”, instead having one integrated interface that supports end-to-end coding and documentation review.

9. Guiding Less Experienced Coders with Static Resources
To assist junior coders or those less familiar with Australian coding standards, the system should incorporate built-in guidance from static resources like the Australian Coding Standards (ACS) and National Coding Advice. These references contain the rules and FAQs that coders normally flip open in manuals; in an assistant, they can be made context-sensitive. For example, if a coder is coding an infarction and selects an ICD-10-AM code, the interface could alert them to check ACS 0941 (hypothetical example) if applicable, or automatically display a snippet of the relevant standard in a side panel. 
The assistant can also include a searchable knowledge base of the ACS and the National Coding Advice – Thirteenth Edition (the coding rules and FAQs effective July 2025). This allows coders to type a question or keyword (e.g. “diabetes with complication coding rule”) and retrieve official advice excerpts. In fact, leading Australian coding software embeds these references directly; for instance, 3M Codefinder integrates the National Coding Advice and even state-specific query databases so that coders can open them on-screen. Providing quick access to definitions and rules helps less experienced coders ensure they are applying standards correctly.
Beyond passive references, the system can offer real-time decision support based on these static rules. This means implementing coding edits and prompts derived from the ACS and national guidelines. As the coder enters codes, the software can validate the combination and sequence, warning if something violates a rule or if additional codes are needed.

For example, if a coder assigns a poisoning code without an external cause, the system should flag this (since Australian standards require an external cause code for poisonings). Such edits can be drawn from published Coding Rules, National Coding Advice, and the ICD-10-AM/ACHI coding conventions. The assistant might say, for instance, “According to ACS 1902, an adverse effect code must be accompanied by a code for the specific drug – please add the external cause code.” This kind of on-screen feedback ensures compliance and teaches the coder the correct approach. 
Essentially, the static resources (coding standards, advice, guidelines) are baked into the system’s logic and help system. For novice coders, this is like having a mentor looking over their shoulder – they not only get the “what” (the code) but also the “why” (the rule behind it). Additionally, providing examples from the Coding Advice (e.g. sample scenarios and how they are coded) within the tool can reinforce learning. 

By integrating these Australian resources, the assistant guides coders to the correct classification and promotes consistency. The goal is to boost coder confidence and accuracy by making the wealth of coding standards readily available at the point of coding. This reduces reliance on memory or flipping through manuals, thereby helping less experienced coders make the right decisions in line with Australian coding practice.

Sources: The answer draws on the ICD-10-AM/ACHI/ACS Thirteenth Edition standards and related Australian coding guidance. Key features and expectations are informed by the Clinical Coding Practice Framework (October 2024) and IHACPA resources, as well as capabilities described in industry-leading Australian coding software (e.g. 3M CodeFinder and Beamtree’s Q Coding Platform). National coding advice publications and data reporting guidelines have been referenced to ensure the design aligns with Australian requirements and best practices.
